# Angular 2 Form

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.21.

The goal of this project is to submit a form with one file upload and two text fields. The form is submitted to back end, the file is stored in the `uploads/forms/:userID` and then the file name (string) is stored in MongoDB among the two text fields. At the end, the form ID is assinged to the signed in user ID (via Ref) for later viewing all the form fields and file in the front end. User profile image is stored at `uploads/profiles/:userID`.

##Prerequisites
1. MongoDB installed and running (http://mongodb.org)
2. Node.js and NPM installed (http://nodejs.org)
3. [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) or [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) installed,
more info in [gm](https://github.com/aheckmann/gm) page on how to install depending your Operating System. If installing ImageMagick on Windows, please check "Install Legacy Utitities (e.g. convert") during installation otherwise node will report errors.

## Specs
1. User login/signup using JSON Web Token (jwt)
2. User password reset via email (nodemailer & SendGrid)
3. Toastr Notifications (& Error Handling)
4. Multipart form submission with image preview before upload (some of the upload logic is taken from primeng ui).
5. Storing images to file system
6. Storing image path to MongoDB among text fields
7. Triple check if image is actually a file by checking it's mime type in both back end and in front end (`gm` in back end checks if file is an image too by reading first bytes of the file, need to fix this to not allow form to be submitted at all)
8. Double check for the image size in both back end and front end, file limit now is 5.000.000 bytes (5MB)
9. Image resize server side using [GraphicsMagick](https://github.com/aheckmann/gm)
10. Form deletion among the file from filesystem, user forms array is updated too.
11. Edit form, user can edit the text inputs and the image or update only the image or update only the text fields.
12. Admin area, admin can edit or delete all forms in database
13. User Profile area, user can upload a profile picture, change his password, view profile info like email, user id, role and joined date
